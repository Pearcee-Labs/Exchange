      <p>
        <br>On Saturday 10th of March, eighteen of us were lucky enough to be involved in the UK Comenius week. Throughout the week we went on many excursions; London, Oxford, Plymouth University, the Eden Project and Stonehenge to name a few. We had a wonderful week full of so many incredible memories that we will cherish for a lifetime. 
        On the first day we were all both nervous and excited about meeting our exchange partners – but upon meeting them our nerves disappeared as we anticipated the incredible week we would have together. The English, German and Romanian groups went on a walking tour of London and the English girls acted as tour guides to show off the best of the city. We then went on the London Eye and we enjoyed taking many pictures and watched the street entertainment from the pod.</br>

        <br>The next day was another successful and memorable day as we go the opportunity to visit the London Science Museum, investigating and learning about science, maths and engineering. We then travelled to Oxford on the coach whilst playing many card games and learning little bits of German, Romanian and Croatian where possible. We all found it very interesting to learn little bits of all the languages, but naturally our pronunciation wasn’t brilliant!</br>

        <br>When we arrived in Oxford we went on a walking tour of the city, learning a lot about the different colleges in the university of Oxford and the history of the academic part of the city. We then went to the youth hostel and got ready to go out for the evening, splitting up into groups and going to separate restaurants to get to know the people around us.</br>

        <br>On Monday morning our very tired group went to the mathematical institute in Oxford for a lecture on topology. The lecture lasted the whole morning and presented many mathematical question and problems for us to solve. After leaving the university we set off to Stonehenge, where learning about the mystery behind the famous rocks took up the rest of the afternoon. That evening we took our partners home for the first time to meet our families and to get them settled into normal life in Plymouth.</br>

        <br>On Tuesday we went into school for the morning, for the foreign students it was the first time that they had been in an English school and for us it gave us a chance to show off our school. In the afternoon our partners went off for a tour of the city while we were stuck in school!
        On Wednesday we all went to the Eden project for the day, we did a workshop on the Eden Project and art. We were split into groups and were told to create a sculpture which told a story about the chocolate trade, our group designed a chocolate train where each carriage told the story of the trade and it was made out of sustainable material. In the evening we all went out bowling as a whole group, followed by a meal out at Pizza Express.</br>

        <br>On Thursday we stayed in school while our partners and the Year 10s went to Plymouth University and visited the planetarium and learnt the ways which maths was incorporated in the stars. On Friday we all stayed in school for the whole day, in small groups we did presentations about the week and at the end of the day we presented them to the rest of the group, the senior management team and any parents who wanted to come in. 
        Saturday was our last morning together as we had to drop our partners off at the train station early in the morning – after lots of teary goodbyes we waved off our visitors (after nearly making them miss the train!) and hoped that someday we would get the chance to all meet up again sometime outside of the project.</br>
