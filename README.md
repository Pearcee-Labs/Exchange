Exchange
========

This project was something my girlfriend asked me to do for an exchange project 
she has. She needed something to show off at an exchange trip and being the only 
person she knows with some degree of web development skills she asked me to make 
something for her with the information she provided for me. Basically I made a 
website displaying a lot of information and a lot of pictures which was very 
tedious to enter. It was a very easy task but very boring. Its built with basic 
HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
