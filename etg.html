    <p>
      <br>On Saturday 16th October, before the sun had risen 6 Year 11 students congregated at Park and Ride. It was here that despite our fatigue from the early morning we were all buzzing with excitement to board a small mini bus that was to act as our shuttle to Heathrow airport. 
      The flight to Germany was quite short yet due to our excitement it felt like ages! Arriving in Germany was incredibly exciting, as we left the airport in Munich, we were immediately greeted by the outstandingly friendly Croatian and Romanian students whom we got to know on the coach journey to our partner school. </br>

      <br>Meeting our exchange hosts was very scary, although we had contacted them all via email beforehand we had so much to learn about them and their lifestyles. Despite the majority of us not knowing any German the language barrier did not cause a problem as actions and descriptions came in very handy as well as the German students’ prior knowledge of the English language.</br>

      <br>The first night was an early one for most as although we were anticipating the fun ahead, the long journey had been tiring. 
      The cities and towns we visited in Germany were all excellent. The first place we visited was Leipzig and Leipzig university, although the lecture we had there was entirely in German diagrams enabled us all to gain a basic understanding of some of Möbius’ theorems. We were soon taken to Schulpforta boarding school and were amazed by how gifted the students had to be to study there and were amused by the ex-monastery’s traditions.</br>
   
      <br>Nuremburg was the next place on our travels. We were all immediately stunned by the beautiful architecture as well as the famous Der Schönen Brunnen fountain of which we eagerly span the gold ring hoping for the luck provided by the philosophers, holy men and royalty depicted. It was in Nuremburg that our hunger for German culture was satisfied—with our first taste of pretzels (they’re scrumptious!)
      Berlin soon followed which was a fascinating experience. We had all experienced our own capital city and we were all surprised how different the two are not! However Berlin redeemed itself after a visit to the 3D lab at the University. This offered a select group of students a fascinating insight into 3D Printing as well as the future of 3D video gaming. Some of the interactive projections included, the Moon, the inside of a puffer fish as well as a dinosaur skeleton.</br> 

      <br>After another sleepless night in a youth hostel, we travelled to Jena which was a little town that had much character. We spent a lot of free time roaming the centre and were allowed to split into smaller groups to find dinner. Our group went to a Pizzeria and it was here we had our toughest experience with the language barrier as none of us (or them!) spoke German. Having finally eaten our fill we headed back to the coach to wait for the teachers; who must have also had problems as they were very late…
      The day in Jena was very interesting, we all visited ‘The Imaginata’ which was an interactive science museum that taught us through experiments that we could all take part in. some of the activities included a 3D Mobius rollercoaster ride. Another of the activities was a completely dark tunnel with obstacles in which you had to navigate, the scariest part was hearing the screams just before entering. 
      Upon returning to Augsburg we all had opportunity to bond with them as we returned to their house. We were all surprised at how big the German houses are with many more rooms than the average house in Plymouth! The exchange families were once again very welcoming, spoiling us all with German treats but allowing us to all feel part of the family; I helped the youngest boy in the family with his pronunciation of English words he was learning in school.</br> 

      <br>The following day was spent in the German school working on Mobius based activities. This included creating an ‘Applications of the Mobius Strip in Science’ presentation which was a struggle on the German computers! Fortunately our peers were glad to help and many of us even got to contact our friends back in Plymouth via Facebook which was allowed on their computers. 
      A large group of us were invited out on a trip into the local city centre where we were challenged to bowling and a trip to KFC. We had great laughs and made many memories including running for the train home.<br> 

      <br>The final evening spent with the families was an emotional one. Although we had only known each other for a short period of time close bonds were made and strong friendships were built; gifts were exchanged and memories recounted. My exchange family even insisted I learn more German so that I could impress my family at home!</br>

      <br>Overall the week in Germany was a great experience, allowing people from different countries to bond. I have made some valuable friends during the process whom I hope to keep in contact with as well as developing my own confidence both as a person and as a traveller. I have gained a lot of knowledge about a few mathematical theories as well as European history of Maths and mathematicians.</br>
