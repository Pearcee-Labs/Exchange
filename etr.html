        <br>Although for everyone else the trip started on Saturday for us it started the night before as we had to face a six hour coach journey up to Luton airport as we had a flight the next morning at a ridiculous time in the morning. Ok, so maybe the flight itself wasn’t a particularly horrible time, as it was at 8:30, but no matter how much we told ourselves that getting up at 5:30 said differently. The flight itself was pretty uneventful and many of us managed to catch up on some sleep that we all needed. We landed at 1:30 Romanian time in Timisoara and got on a minibus that would take us to Arad to meet our partners; our first impression of Romania was the greenery, everywhere we looked it was covered in fields and trees the complete opposite to England. That night we stayed with our host families in Arad, trying to catch up on lost sleep ready for our two nights away that were happening next. However as all good plans that didn’t pan out as all  the hosts had organised a night out at one of the pubs in Arad which gave us a chance to meet most of the other people on the trip, apart from the Croatians who had had a long travel time and had actually gone to bed.</br>
        <br>The next day we all woke up bright and early at 6:30 ready to head off to our first stop of the day Corvin Castle, however at the time none of us really knew where we were going. When we arrived at the castle it was about midday and we were all very happy to be getting of the coach. The castle itself was absolutely magnificent, the architecture was gorgeous and you could sense that it had a very rich history behind it; when we got inside we had a guided tour of the castle taking in most of the rooms, as well as learning about the various myths and legends behind aspects of the castle. After a couple of hours at the castle we boarded back onto the coach and headed off towards Alba-Iulia. When we arrived we had a tour of the museum within the citadel which held many important Romanian documents vital to their history; after the tour we had the opportunity to walk around the wall of the citadel which gave us an idea of the force it would’ve taken to take the city. After that we had some free time in the city and Fran had heard rumours that there was a Zara in the city centre so led us all of on a quest to find it; unfortunately after wondering round for about half an hour we couldn’t find it so gave up and went back to the coach. And off we went again this time heading towards our hotel for the night in Sibiu; the hotel was lovely it was a four star Continental, which we took great advantage of. That evening we headed out to find somewhere nice for dinner and ran across a nice little Italian place, where we discovered just how cheap Romania actually was when Daisy managed to order a steak for the equivalent of £10.</br>
        <br>The next morning we were able to get up at a nicer time of eight o’clock and we had to be out at ten o’clock for a tour of Sibiu, which took in the citadel and the three fortification walls which would’ve surrounded the city when they were originally built. Then we bundled back onto the coach and headed toward our next stop of Sigişoara, the birth place of the famous Count Dracula. We spent a couple of hours in the city taking in some of the sight like the steps leading up to the church and the school, the tailor’s tower and the birthplace of Dracula. For many of us this was also the sight of our first purchase (which wasn’t food) so gave us a great feeling. When we finished we again got back onto the coach and headed off to Turda where we were to have dinner and some free time; when we arrived we headed straight for the mall looking for an opportunity to shop and hopefully find the elusive Zara we had been searching for from the first day. Unfortunately we didn’t find a Zara however Katie was happy as she managed to get in a couple of hours shopping before we headed off to the hostel where we were spending the night.</br> 
        <br>When we woke up the next morning the late nights and early mornings were starting to take their toll on us as we were all starting to feel very tired; however we dealt with it and got back onto the coach and headed to the nearby salt mines. Which were absolutely amazing everything was so pretty, unfortunately for Harriet she didn’t like heights so she tried not to look down too much when we were walking over the top of the mines. When we got some free time we decided to go rowing around the indoor lake, in which Katie decided she was going to row; after going round in circles for a bit Katie finally got her rhythm and we had quite a bit of fun out on the lake trying to race against Fran and Rachael (they’d had a head start hence they won). After the salt mine we headed on the long trek back to Arad; when we eventually arrived back in Arad most of us decided just to go back to our partners’ houses and try and catch up on sleep that we had lost the past couple of days.</br>
        <br>The next day we headed off to spend the morning in their school, Colegiul Moise Nicoară, where we did some presentations in groups as well as making Klein bottles out of various materials, our given material was clay. We spent the morning working on these then got sent out on a treasure hunt around Arad taking various photos with different things like: hugging strangers, taking photos with policemen etc. After this we all met up and got on another coach and headed off toward the Arad natural park, in which we had the opportunity to take out some bikes and cycle around the park to get close and see the beauty of it for ourselves. That evening a few of us headed out to the mall in Arad and finally we found a Zara after days of searching it was there in Arad from the beginning, however Fran wasn’t there to enjoy it so we had to for her. After the mall shut at ten we headed out to watch the football with everyone else in the project as it was some German team playing so we all had to act like we knew what was happening.</br> 
        <br>On Thursday we spent the day in Timisoara in the morning we went to the university and partook in a maths lecture taken by one of the professors at the uni. We then had a city tour led by one of the members of the projects, Sara, which led us finally to the massive mall in which we had five hours to spend however we wished. It was in this mall where Fran finally found her Zara; however even though we had been searching for it for days no one actually bought anything. That evening we went out to the karaoke at one of the pubs in Arad and we all got to laugh at each other’s amazing singing.</br> 
        <br>Our final full day was the Friday in which we went back into their school and finished off our presentations and also made presentations on each day that we had been in the country; after our time in school we had some free time before our evening meal so many went back to our hosts house and had a nap. Then we went to a local hotel for an arranged meal that was paid for by the school and then after that we all went back to the bar we spent the first night in to say our final goodbyes. At 1:30 we finally left the pub and tried to catch an hour’s sleep before we had to go home. We said goodbye to our partners with much sadness as we would all miss them loads. We all had an amazing week and none of us are going to forget it anytime soon; it was really well organised and carried out very well. We all made lifelong friends and have memories that will last forever.</br>
