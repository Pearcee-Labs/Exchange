     <p>
      <br>Many times in life, people are held back by confusion and uncertainty when they have to make a decision or choose a path to follow. What if we could defeat all obstacles and travel along a smooth line where there is only one surface to follow? The Möbius strip is an inspiring mathematical creation by Augustus Ferdinand Möbius, the German mathematician.</br>

      <br>In Sonnet 116, William Shakespeare said “Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, but bears it out to the edge of doom.” Taking his ideas and putting them into the image of a Möbius strip unveils the idea that we should not be twisting and altering ourselves constantly but focusing on a goal and bearing it out. If love were one continuous surface in our confusing world, just as the strip is one surface (a two dimensional object) in a three dimensional world, then problem-causing anxieties and pressures would not be so challenging to deal with. We could forget the fact that in our minds something may not make sense and we could attempt and achieve so much more. </br>

      <br>To make a one-sided surface, all you need to do is twist one end of a strip of paper and then join the ends together. Maybe it is that easy to make a crucial change in life too. If we twist one end of something that is in our way, if we destroy that obstacle, then we could end up with something we could never have dreamed of. All we have to do is take that one thing, whether it is big or small, and with a little twist, we can achieve what nobody has achieved before. When the Möbius strip creator himself was working on his projects and mathematics, it is unlikely that he ever knew just how phenomenal his creation would be. If we can harness the same determination, concentration and perseverance that he had, then with a little inspiration, we can also achieve wondrous outcomes. </br>

      <br>A Möbius Strip – A Poem</br>

      <br>This strip of strange paper has but one side, 
      the other side cannot be found. 
      If you draw a straight line down its middle 
      you’ll find it’s entirely round. 
      You start at one spot, just like we were taught 
      and follow it through on its face. 
      You’ll glide all its length, 
      whether red, white or pink 
      Until you came to that very same place. 
      What’s more if you try to cut it in half, 
      by following that line just drew. 
      When you are done, you’ll have only one, 
      and so you can’t even cut it in two. 
      It really is peculiar when this strip you place, 
      But I’ll give a wonderful tip. 
      Put half-twist in one end, stick it end to end, 
      The result is a Möbius strip.</br>
