      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>
        August Ferdinand Möbius was born November 17th 1790 in Schulpforta in Germany. 
        He was educated at home until the age of thirteen, whereupon, already showing aptitude in Mathematics, he attended college in Schulpforta.
        Three years later he attended the University of Leipzig and studied Astronomy, Maths and Physics. He was influenced predominantly by Mollweide, a great astronomer. 
        In 1813, Möbius travelled to Göttingen and studied Astronomy under Gauss. Then Möbius travelled to Halle and studied Mathematics under Pfaff, so he was well versed in both topics.
        Möbius wrote his Doctoral thesis in 1815 on the occultation of fixed stars but the most famous of all Möbius’ achievements were in the realm of topology—the Möbius strip.
        In 1816, Möbius became an Extraordinary Professor of Astronomy at the University of Leipzig but, unfortunately, had difficulties due to lack of interest in his lectures and did not advance quickly.
        He was, however, offered a full professorial post at Leipzig in 1844 after his research gained prominence. Other Universities offered Möbius posts but his loyalty to Leipzig endured.
        Möbius married Dorothea Christiane Johanne Rothe Möbius in 1820 and had one daughter (Emilie D’Arrest Möbius) and two sons (August Theodore and Paul Heinrich Möbius).
        August Ferdinand Möbius died on the 26th September 1868 at the age of 78.

        <h3>The Mӧbius Strip</h3>
      <p>
        Mӧbius was most famous for his discovery of the eponymous Mӧbius strip, a band with only one side and only one boundary component. The strip has the mathematical property of being non-orientable, and cannot be realised as a ruled surface. It was also independently discovered by Johann Benedict Listing at approximately the same time.
        The band can be made using a strip of paper by gluing the two ends together with a half twist in the middle; the twist is possible in two directions so there are only two possible Mӧbius strips, which are mirror images of each other. The strip has many unusual properties – for example, a bug crawling along the centre line of the band would have travelled twice around before it came back to its starting place. Furthermore, cutting along the centre line of the loop creates one longer band with two twists in it instead of two separate loops as would be expected.
