        <br>When we finally arrived at Zagreb Airport on Saturday evening, it was torture to see Nina stood behind the glass whilst I impatiently fidgeted whilst waiting for my suitcase to arrive after having to spend seven cruel months waiting to see her and the others again! From the very first night I was immersed in the Croatian culture, beginning with a late meal with Nina’s parents (štrukli – a national dish) before heading off to one of Nina’s close friends’ 18th birthday party, where everybody was eager to talk to me simply because I was English.</br>

       <br>The next morning we all got a coach to Krapina to visit the Neanderthal Museum, which is situated where their remains were discovered. The most interesting part of this for me was the realistic waxworks that allow you to grasp what the Neanderthals would really have looked like, although it was disappointing that I got told off somewhat sternly every time I tried to sneakily take a photo. After a spectacular Croatian lunch (with perhaps a few too many courses for my appetite to handle!) in a nearby restaurant, we travelled to Trakošćan Castle to look around the rooms that have been restored and so appear exactly as they did between the 15th and 19th century; the grounds were particularly beautiful, with a colossal lake surrounded by thick green trees. Later that evening I presented my gifts to Nina’s parents (a bottle of Plymouth Gin plus earl grey tea and a few boxes of chocolates that her younger brother instantly dived into) which they loved simply because they were “British”.</br>

      <br>On Monday we had a tour of the school, which is highly unusual compared to our school in that all students study sixteen compulsory subjects. The maths lesson I attended was also different in that it was much more logic-based than our syllabus is – with the help of five boys who taught me that the Croatian word for bread was what was actually their word for ‘Albanians’, I completed a worksheet on Dirichlet’s pigeonhole principle. In the short break afterwards I tried my first burek of the week - a pastry made with thin dough that is filled with either soft cheese or minced meat - which I ended up eating every day from then on simply as it was so delicious! Next up was our tour of Zagreb’s city centre, for which we split into three groups to explore different areas. The best part of the tour was definitely the old town, with the impressively bright tiled roof of St. Mark’s Church and quirky museums and galleries (such as the “Museum of Broken Relationships”). That afternoon we went back to the school to take part in a workshop on imaginary numbers in programming, which we used to create some really colourful patterns on an axis.</br>

      <br>On Tuesday we travelled out to the Plitvice Lakes, a breathtaking National Park in the centre of the country that consists of sixteen lakes interconnected by a series of waterfalls. At first it seemed disappointing that it rained on this day only, but the extra water actually made the waterfalls much more impressive! After an excruciatingly long coach journey we finally arrived in Opatija, one of the most popular tourist resorts in Croatia, where we travelled to the neighbouring city of Rijeka to visit the planetarium; the sky was perfectly clear for observing the constellations through the telescope. After spending the night in the eponymous Hotel Opatija we travelled to Motovun, a quaint medieval village with spectacular views of the surrounding countryside. Before returning to Zagreb we stopped at Poreč, the capital of the Istrian peninsula, to complete a task involving answering questions about the history of the city and exchange a Möbius comic strip for an item from the area. This was ridiculously difficult as many of the locals and tourists didn’t want to swap anything with us; we made up for our poor exchange by scoring the highest on our list of questions. That night Nina and I were too exhausted from the two-day trip to even have dinner when we arrived home, so we went straight to bed!
      The next two days – Thursday and Friday – went by unbelievably quickly. On the Thursday we attended a workshop on knot theory, which was really interesting and different to anything we usually cover in school, and then the majority of the group went for a traditional Croatian pub lunch on Ilica, the main shopping street in Zagreb. After this I went to the contemporary art museum, where I constructed a card hat out of multiple Möbius strips in a workshop that demonstrated how maths forms a key part of art. That evening was spent in a funky modern coffee bar – complete with blue lights and fish tanks! – but nobody stayed for long as the lack of sleep throughout the week was beginning to take its toll.</br>

      <br>I didn’t want to wake up on the final day knowing that I had such little time left with Nina and her family, but making our PowerPoint presentations on the events of the week and listening to the other countries’ presentations was definitely a funny end to the trip. Dominic took it upon himself to buy a fresh rose for every girl in the project, which added a sweet touch to the school t-shirts and other presents that were given to us. After taking many photos with each other in the main hall, everybody said goodbye for the last time and left to spend their final afternoon with their partners. Nina and I went shopping in Zagreb, with the main objective of buying gifts for my friends and family – we also stopped at a traditional patisserie with her younger sister, where we ordered perhaps a few too many cakes to share! That evening Nina’s mum cooked a spectacular final meal, but instead of packing for the journey home Nina and I went out to see her friends at a coffee bar back in the city centre. Despite moaning at having to be taken home at midnight, we both knew deep down that we would regret staying out in the morning! After a short time in bed and a final panic to gather my belongings, I was finally ready to leave the country – although that was the last thing I wanted to do! The ridiculous delay at the airport provided me with the opportunity to reflect on how fantastic the week had been and how lucky I was to have had the opportunity to go on the exchange, which I would definitely recommend to anybody as the experience really opened my eyes about daily life in other cultures in a way that a holiday abroad couldn’t ever compare to.</br>
